# Pieman


Pieman is an attempt of getting to grips with an fMRI data set that recorded brain activity while subjects were listening to Jim O'Grady's [Pie Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nZzSUDECLo) story.

The sole purpose of this project is to apply some of the ideas from a statistical methods class I took on a real data set for practice.
