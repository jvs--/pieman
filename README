Pieman
==

Pieman is a toy project analysing a fMRI data set that recorded brain activity while subjects were listening to Jim O'Grady's [Pie Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nZzSUDECLo) story.

Primarily, this project looked at correlations between Brodmann areas.
Here is an example graph showing correlations between area 41 and 42:
